FFX Runner, which also goes by its beta name *Alias Runner* and the Miniclip release *On The Run*, is a game where you are in control of a yellow car, stuck at a red light as you proceed to go through yet another boring day. However, someone has been following you, as you notice a black SUV sitting behind you, about to lash out and run into your car. You have no idea who these people are or what they want from you. You have no weapons and a limited fuel reserve, and cannot win against them. The light in front of you turns green, and there's only one thing you should do: Run and find an escape!  Pick up the bonuses along the map to get extra fuel and get car repair.

## A Shockwave Classic
FFX Runner is a Shockwave Player game that has been featured on dozens of browser gaming websites in the mid-2000s. The game's straightforward and easy to pick up gameplay made it addicting for countless players. After the death of Adobe's Shockwave Player and Flash, we have decided to release the source code for anybody to look at and modify. We hope to see FFX Runner continue to live on past Shockwave Player.
